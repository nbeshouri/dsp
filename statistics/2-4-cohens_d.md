[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> First babies are on average 0.125 pounds lighter than other babies. This difference is 0.089 standard deviationsâ€”more than the 0.029 deviations for the difference in pregnancy length, but still not very large.
